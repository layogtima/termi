# Terminal üååüöÄ

The Terminal is an interactive cyberpunk narrative experience powered by OpenAI's GPT. In this experience, you'll communicate with a forsaken autonomous ship whose Terminal is accessible to you, navigating through a story set in a cyberpunk universe. This project uses HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Flask to create a captivating and immersive experience for the user.

## Features

- Interactive cyberpunk narrative
- Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 for dynamic conversations and story progression
- Customizable user interface with retro-futuristic design elements
- Typing and ambient sound effects
- Oscilloscope visualization of audio

## Project Structure

This project contains the following files and directories:

- `index.html` : Main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the Terminal.
- `styles.css` : CSS file for styling the Terminal.
- `script.js` : JavaScript file for handling user interactions and dynamic elements.
- `index.py` : Python Flask application handling GPT API requests and responses.
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies for running the Flask application.

## Customizing Your Adventure

Feel free to customize your Terminal experience by modifying the HTML, JavaScript, or Python code. This allows you to create your own adventures, change the user interface, or add new features to the game. Have fun experimenting and making Terminal your own!

## ü§ù Contributions & To-Do List

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues on GitHub. Here's our current to-do list:

- Implement option selection for easier user interaction. Right now it's all chat-driven.
- Incorporate event-driven scenarios (e.g., distress signals, meteorite detections) for Terminal-prompted actions.
- Integrate the Python planner from Semantic Kernel for further development.
- Focus on mobile accessibility and deployment to allow easy sharing and playtesting.
- Explore basic authentication and consider integration with the prompt interface. Maybe magic links?
- Reevaluate jQuery usage and consider supporting modern alternatives.
- Rewrite necessary parts of the terminal and deploy it as an open-source library.
